# SudokuSolver
This is a simple SudokuSolver. I have right now created two versions of the solver.

1. First one uses simple backtracking to solve the puzzle. 

2. Second one is more advanced and uses Knuth's Algorithm X. It has been implemented using the Danching Links structure. 

Right now no GUI has been created for it but I intend to revisit it as soon as possible. Please feel free to use the code after citing the author.
